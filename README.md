Hi, my name is Lazar Krmpot, a junior Frontend web developer who is expanding his roster of projects and constantly learning new ways to further my experience and expand my developer skills.

Currently in my final year at College of Applied Technical Sciences in Nis Serbia with my major being Modern Computer Technologies.

In my opinion, we all are in the learning phase, and we get better at it by teaching ourselves something new every day. And that is what I am doing.

My skills among the others:

1) JavaScript 
2) HTML
3) CSS3 
4) Sass
5) jQuery 
6) Git
